# tools
A collection of scripts designed to complete a specific task. Scripts should be:

1) Well commented
2) Complete a discrete task
3) Self contained (i.e. the user should only need to change a filepath for the code to run).

<> should be used to designate where the user needs to enter own string e.g. for a filepath.
